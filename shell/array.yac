= Shell Array:
  names=( Jennifer Tonya Anna Sadie )

== The following expression evaluates into all values of the array:
  ${names[@]}

== iterate through this array one value at a time:
  for name in ${names[@]}
  do
    echo $name
    # other stuff on $name
  done

== loop through an array and know the numeric index of the array you are using:
  for (( i = 0 ; i < ${#names[@]} ; i++ ))
  do
    echo ${names[$i]}
    # yadda yadda
  done
